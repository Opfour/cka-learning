# CKA Learning Repo

My notes and preparation materials for Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam. This repo may also contain additional resources and links which are not related to CKA, but generally useful for Kubernetes administration

# Things to learn and research

* LXC containers
* Kubernetes the hard way <https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way>
* <killer.sh> Possibly a good way to experience the exam environment. Need to check if it provides free access
* <https://github.com/alijahnas/CKA-practice-exercises>
* play with kind

# Plan

1. Complete `Kubernetes the hard way` using LXC containers and document the steps (Or maybe using digitalocean droplets)
1. Go through a CKA excercises repo and try out all the excercises
1. Register for the Exam
1. Master the kubernetes official documentation
1. Take some sample test from somewhere
